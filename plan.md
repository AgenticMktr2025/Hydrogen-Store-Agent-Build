# Hydrogen Site Builder - Complete Rebuild âœ…

## Project Overview
Building a local/hostable AI agent that transforms natural-language briefs + brand guidelines + Shopify credentials into production-ready Hydrogen storefronts deployed to Oxygen.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Reflex (Python web framework)
- AI Models: OpenAI (primary) and Anthropic (fallback)
- Orchestration: Goose agent integration (future)
- Shopify: Hydrogen framework, Storefront API, Oxygen hosting
- Validation: Custom code quality validator (NeMo Guardrails attempted but requires C++ compiler)
- Testing: Lighthouse, axe-core, Vitest (future integration)

**Current Status:** âœ… All phases complete including validation stage!

---

## Phase 1: Core Application Structure âœ…
Build the foundation with state management, UI layout, and brief input system.

- [x] Create main state class with brief input fields (brief_text, brand_guidelines, shopify_domain, storefront_token, private_token)
- [x] Build header with app title and navigation
- [x] Create brief input page with form (textarea for brief, brand guidelines, Shopify credentials)
- [x] Add sidebar with progress tracking and status indicators
- [x] Implement spec JSON display area for generated specifications
- [x] Set up basic routing structure (/, /specs, /files, /review, /deploy)

---

## Phase 2: AI Integration & Spec Generation âœ…
Integrate OpenAI API for AI-powered spec extraction and file generation.

- [x] Create OpenAI client wrapper for spec generation (using gpt-4o-mini)
- [x] Implement spec extraction event handler (brief â†’ Store Spec JSON with ALL required fields)
- [x] Fix prompt to include complete schema template ensuring all fields are returned
- [x] Validate nav structure returns objects with label/href (not plain strings)
- [x] Build spec preview component with JSON syntax highlighting
- [x] Add progress tracking state with real-time updates
- [x] Add error handling and validation for API responses
- [x] Test complete workflow: Brief input â†’ Spec generation â†’ All fields verified

---

## Phase 3: File Generation & Review System âœ…
Complete the workflow with file generation, review UI, and deployment preparation.

- [x] Implement file plan generator (Store Spec â†’ Hydrogen file tree with intents)
- [x] Create file generation event handler (spec â†’ actual Hydrogen code files)
- [x] Build file explorer component showing generated file tree
- [x] Add code preview panel with syntax highlighting (TypeScript/JSX/CSS)
- [x] Create HITL review interface with deployment summary
- [x] Add deployment status tracking and file count display
- [x] Implement progress tracking through complete workflow (25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%)
- [x] Test complete workflow: Spec â†’ File Plan â†’ Generated Files â†’ Review
- [x] Fix crash after generation by removing automatic file generation trigger
- [x] Fix markdown code fence stripping for clean code display

---

## Phase 4: Multi-Provider AI System Fixed âœ…

### Provider System Overhaul
- [x] Fix provider selection to use environment variables (os.getenv) instead of state properties
- [x] Remove broken OpenRouter and Mistral code paths
- [x] Implement working OpenAI primary provider
- [x] Implement working Anthropic fallback provider
- [x] Fix return value handling (client, model tuple)
- [x] Update all generation methods to handle both OpenAI and Anthropic responses
- [x] Remove model validation code that caused 404 errors
- [x] Test complete provider system end-to-end

---

## Phase 5: Critical File Generation Fixes âœ…

### All Critical Issues FIXED
- [x] **Empty file content on first navigation** - Files now generate immediately when "Generate File Plan" button is clicked on /specs page
- [x] **Markdown code fence stripping** - Enhanced `_strip_markdown_code` to properly handle ```tsx, ```typescript, ```jsx, ```javascript, ```ts, ```js, ``` formats
- [x] **Wrong directory structure** - Files now generate in `hydrogen_output/` directory with proper Hydrogen project structure
- [x] **Review & Deploy split** - Successfully separated into distinct /review and /deploy pages with appropriate functionality
- [x] **Updated navigation flow** - Brief â†’ Spec â†’ Files (auto-generates) â†’ Validate â†’ Review â†’ Deploy
- [x] **Download functionality** - Review page includes download project as zip capability
- [x] **GitHub integration prep** - Deploy page ready for GitHub push using GITHUB_TOKEN env var
- [x] **Progress tracking** - Updated percentages: 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 90% â†’ 92% â†’ 95% â†’ 100%

---

## Phase 6: Code Validation & Quality Assurance âœ…

### Validation Stage Implementation Complete
Successfully added "Validate" stage between "Files" and "Review" to ensure generated code quality.

- [x] **Custom Validation Framework**
  - [x] Created `app/validation/validator.py` with CodeValidator class
  - [x] Implemented markdown fence detection (```tsx, ```typescript, etc.)
  - [x] Added Hydrogen import verification (@shopify/hydrogen-react)
  - [x] Implemented route structure validation (loader/meta exports)
  - [x] Fixed triple backtick detection using chr(96) approach

- [x] **Code Quality Checks**
  - [x] Verify all files are valid TypeScript/JSX (not markdown)
  - [x] Check for markdown code fences in generated files
  - [x] Validate proper Hydrogen API usage (@shopify/hydrogen-react)
  - [x] Verify Storefront API client patterns (context.storefront.query)
  - [x] Check for proper loader/meta exports in route files

- [x] **Validation State Management**
  - [x] Added `is_validating` boolean to track validation progress
  - [x] Added `validation_results` dict to store issues per file
  - [x] Added `validation_passed` computed var for overall status
  - [x] Implemented `validate_all_files()` event handler

- [x] **Validation UI Page**
  - [x] Created /validate route with clean, professional interface
  - [x] Display validation status (âœ“ Pass, âœ— Fail, âš  Warning)
  - [x] Show detailed issues with file path and line number
  - [x] Added "Run Validation" button with loading state
  - [x] Navigation: "Back to Files" and "Proceed to Review" (enabled when passed)
  - [x] Color-coded results (green for pass, red for errors, yellow for warnings)

- [x] **Integration & Testing**
  - [x] Updated navigation flow: Files â†’ Validate â†’ Review â†’ Deploy
  - [x] Updated sidebar with "Validate" nav item (shield-check icon)
  - [x] Updated progress tracking: 90% (files) â†’ 92% (validate) â†’ 95% (review) â†’ 100% (deploy)
  - [x] Tested validation with various code samples
  - [x] Verified markdown fence detection works correctly
  - [x] Tested route structure validation (loader/meta checks)

### Note on NeMo Guardrails
- Attempted to install NeMo Guardrails but requires C++ compiler (g++) which isn't available in environment
- Implemented custom validation framework instead that provides similar safety checks
- Custom validator is lightweight, fast, and covers all critical validation needs
- Future enhancement: Add NeMo Guardrails when C++ compiler becomes available

## Notes
- Using port 8001 (frontend) and 8002 (backend)
- API keys read from environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN
- Custom validation framework provides robust code quality checks
- Validation runs before review to ensure code quality
- HITL can proceed from validation to review manually
- All LLM calls use appropriate response formats (JSON for OpenAI, text parsing for Anthropic)
- File generation produces valid Shopify Hydrogen code
- UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly
- Triple backtick detection uses chr(96) * 3 approach to avoid string literal issues
