- [ ] Generate Shopify Storefront API client and GraphQL queries
- [ ] Create theme system generator (CSS tokens from brand spec)
- [ ] Build package.json and config file generators (vite.config, tsconfig, etc.)
- [ ] Implement file preview system with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add GitHub repo creation and file commit functionality

---

## Phase 4: Verification, Testing, and HITL Review System
**Goal**: Build automated checks and human-in-the-loop approval workflow

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Verifier agent (analyzes build/test/lint/a11y results)
- [ ] Implement automated check runners (build, test, lint, Lighthouse, axe)
- [ ] Build progress tracking UI with real-time status updates
- [ ] Create error report parser and repair suggestion system
- [ ] Implement repair loop (Verifier ‚Üí Coder ‚Üí re-check, max N iterations)
- [ ] Build HITL review interface (side-by-side spec vs. generated code)
- [ ] Add approval/rejection workflow with comments
- [ ] Create GitHub PR creation with check results
- [ ] Implement notification system for review requests

---

## Phase 5: Deployment Pipeline and Production Features
**Goal**: Complete Oxygen deployment automation and polish the application

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build Oxygen deployment workflow generator (.github/workflows/oxygen.yml)
- [ ] Implement deployment status monitoring and logs viewer
- [ ] Create post-deployment verification (smoke tests on live URL)
- [ ] Add project templates library (e-commerce, B2B, subscription, etc.)
- [ ] Build settings page (API keys management, default preferences)
- [ ] Implement project export/import functionality
- [ ] Create usage analytics dashboard (projects, deployments, costs)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- [ ] Build onboarding flow and documentation
- [ ] Polish UI/UX across all pages

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features and Optimization
**Goal**: Add sophisticated capabilities and optimize performance

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement multi-locale support (i18n code generation)
- [ ] Add advanced catalog features (search, filters, badges)
- [ ] Build custom section/component creator
- [ ] Create diff viewer for spec changes and code updates
- [ ] Implement version history and rollback
- [ ] Add collaborative features (team members, comments)
- [ ] Build webhook integration for Shopify events
- [ ] Optimize LLM prompt templates based on usage patterns
- [ ] Add caching layer for common patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive test coverage
