# Hydrogen Site Builder - Complete Rebuild âœ…

## Project Overview
Building a local/hostable AI agent that transforms natural-language briefs + brand guidelines + Shopify credentials into production-ready Hydrogen storefronts deployed to Oxygen.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Reflex (Python web framework)
- AI Models: OpenAI (primary) and Anthropic (fallback)
- Orchestration: Goose agent integration (future)
- Shopify: Hydrogen framework, Storefront API, Oxygen hosting
- Testing: Lighthouse, axe-core, Vitest (future integration)

**Current Status:** All core phases complete. AI provider system fixed and working.

---

## Phase 1: Core Application Structure âœ…
Build the foundation with state management, UI layout, and brief input system.

- [x] Create main state class with brief input fields (brief_text, brand_guidelines, shopify_domain, storefront_token, private_token)
- [x] Build header with app title and navigation
- [x] Create brief input page with form (textarea for brief, brand guidelines, Shopify credentials)
- [x] Add sidebar with progress tracking and status indicators
- [x] Implement spec JSON display area for generated specifications
- [x] Set up basic routing structure (/, /specs, /files, /review)

---

## Phase 2: AI Integration & Spec Generation âœ…
Integrate OpenAI API for AI-powered spec extraction and file generation.

- [x] Create OpenAI client wrapper for spec generation (using gpt-4o-mini)
- [x] Implement spec extraction event handler (brief â†’ Store Spec JSON with ALL required fields)
- [x] Fix prompt to include complete schema template ensuring all fields are returned
- [x] Validate nav structure returns objects with label/href (not plain strings)
- [x] Build spec preview component with JSON syntax highlighting
- [x] Add progress tracking state with real-time updates
- [x] Add error handling and validation for API responses
- [x] Test complete workflow: Brief input â†’ Spec generation â†’ All fields verified

**Key Fix:** Updated prompt to explicitly include the full Store Spec schema template, ensuring LLM returns all required fields (store, brand, nav, catalog, i18n, seo, features, a11y, analytics, environments) with correct structure.

---

## Phase 3: File Generation & Review System âœ…
Complete the workflow with file generation, review UI, and deployment preparation.

- [x] Implement file plan generator (Store Spec â†’ Hydrogen file tree with intents)
- [x] Create file generation event handler (spec â†’ actual Hydrogen code files)
- [x] Build file explorer component showing generated file tree
- [x] Add code preview panel with syntax highlighting (TypeScript/JSX/CSS)
- [x] Create HITL review interface with deployment summary
- [x] Add deployment status tracking and file count display
- [x] Implement progress tracking through complete workflow (25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%)
- [x] Test complete workflow: Spec â†’ File Plan â†’ Generated Files â†’ Review
- [x] Fix crash after generation by removing automatic file generation trigger
- [x] Fix markdown code fence stripping for clean code display

**Implementation Notes:**
- File explorer uses flat list approach (no recursion) for stability
- Split-view layout: file list (320px) + code preview (flex-1)
- Selected file highlighting with click-to-view functionality
- Review page shows file summary and deployment readiness
- All async operations have proper loading states and error handling

## Phase 4: Multi-Provider AI System Fixed âœ…

### Provider System Overhaul
- [x] Fix provider selection to use environment variables (os.getenv) instead of state properties
- [x] Remove broken OpenRouter and Mistral code paths
- [x] Implement working OpenAI primary provider
- [x] Implement working Anthropic fallback provider
- [x] Fix return value handling (client, model tuple)
- [x] Update all generation methods to handle both OpenAI and Anthropic responses
- [x] Remove model validation code that caused 404 errors
- [x] Test complete provider system end-to-end

**Working Provider Priority:**
1. **OpenAI** (Primary)
   - All tasks: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Uses: `AsyncOpenAI` client
   - Response: `response.choices[0].message.content`
   
2. **Anthropic** (Fallback)
   - All tasks: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
   - Uses: `AsyncAnthropic` client
   - Response: `response.content[0].text`

### Hydrogen-Specific Code Generation
- [x] Enhanced prompts with Hydrogen API patterns
- [x] Added Remix/React Router conventions (loader, meta exports)
- [x] Required @shopify/hydrogen-react component usage
- [x] Added Storefront API client patterns (context.storefront.query)
- [x] Included GraphQL query examples
- [x] Added TailwindCSS styling requirements

**Hydrogen Code Requirements:**
- âœ… Routes export: `loader`, `meta`, default component
- âœ… Uses `@shopify/hydrogen-react` components (Money, Image, CartForm)
- âœ… Storefront API client via `context.storefront.query()`
- âœ… Follows Remix conventions (React Router v6+)
- âœ… TypeScript + TailwindCSS for styling
- âœ… SEO and a11y patterns included

**Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Primary provider (âœ“ Available)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Fallback provider (âœ“ Available)

## Summary

âœ… **Complete Application Delivered:**

1. **Brief Input System**: Users can enter project briefs, upload/paste brand guidelines (PDF support), and optionally provide Shopify credentials
2. **AI-Powered Spec Generation**: Multi-provider AI (OpenAI â†’ Anthropic) transforms briefs into Store Spec JSON
3. **File Plan Generation**: LLM analyzes Store Spec and creates comprehensive Hydrogen file tree
4. **Hydrogen Code Generation**: Production-ready TypeScript/JSX/CSS code following Shopify Hydrogen best practices
5. **File Explorer**: Interactive file browser with click-to-preview functionality
6. **Code Preview**: Syntax-highlighted code display for all generated files
7. **Review & Deploy**: Summary page showing file count and deployment readiness
8. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators through entire workflow

**Workflow:**
Brief â†’ Generate Spec (50%) â†’ Generate File Plan (75%) â†’ User clicks "Generate Files" â†’ Files Generated (85%+) â†’ Review (100%) â†’ Deploy

**Key Improvements:**
- âœ… Working multi-provider AI system (OpenAI + Anthropic)
- âœ… Proper environment variable handling
- âœ… Fixed async/response handling for both providers
- âœ… Hydrogen-specific code generation (proper APIs, components, patterns)
- âœ… Markdown code fence stripping for clean display
- âœ… User-triggered file generation (prevents race conditions)

**System Status:**
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Ready to generate Hydrogen storefronts from natural language briefs

**Next Steps (Future Enhancements):**
- GitHub PR integration for code review
- Oxygen deployment automation via Shopify CLI
- Lighthouse/a11y automated testing
- Local testing with Mini-Oxygen
- Goose agent orchestration for autonomous development

## Notes
- Using port 8001 (frontend) and 8002 (backend)
- API keys read from environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- All LLM calls use appropriate response formats (JSON for OpenAI, text parsing for Anthropic)
- File generation produces valid Shopify Hydrogen code with proper patterns
- UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly
- System tested and verified working with real API calls
