# Hydrogen Site Builder - Complete Rebuild âœ…

## Project Overview
Building a local/hostable AI agent that transforms natural-language briefs + brand guidelines + Shopify credentials into production-ready Hydrogen storefronts deployed to Oxygen.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Reflex (Python web framework)
- AI Models: OpenAI (primary) and Anthropic (fallback)
- Orchestration: Goose agent integration (future)
- Shopify: Hydrogen framework, Storefront API, Oxygen hosting
- Testing: Lighthouse, axe-core, Vitest (future integration)

**Current Status:** All core phases complete. Critical file generation issues FIXED âœ…

---

## Phase 1: Core Application Structure âœ…
Build the foundation with state management, UI layout, and brief input system.

- [x] Create main state class with brief input fields (brief_text, brand_guidelines, shopify_domain, storefront_token, private_token)
- [x] Build header with app title and navigation
- [x] Create brief input page with form (textarea for brief, brand guidelines, Shopify credentials)
- [x] Add sidebar with progress tracking and status indicators
- [x] Implement spec JSON display area for generated specifications
- [x] Set up basic routing structure (/, /specs, /files, /review, /deploy)

---

## Phase 2: AI Integration & Spec Generation âœ…
Integrate OpenAI API for AI-powered spec extraction and file generation.

- [x] Create OpenAI client wrapper for spec generation (using gpt-4o-mini)
- [x] Implement spec extraction event handler (brief â†’ Store Spec JSON with ALL required fields)
- [x] Fix prompt to include complete schema template ensuring all fields are returned
- [x] Validate nav structure returns objects with label/href (not plain strings)
- [x] Build spec preview component with JSON syntax highlighting
- [x] Add progress tracking state with real-time updates
- [x] Add error handling and validation for API responses
- [x] Test complete workflow: Brief input â†’ Spec generation â†’ All fields verified

**Key Fix:** Updated prompt to explicitly include the full Store Spec schema template, ensuring LLM returns all required fields (store, brand, nav, catalog, i18n, seo, features, a11y, analytics, environments) with correct structure.

---

## Phase 3: File Generation & Review System âœ…
Complete the workflow with file generation, review UI, and deployment preparation.

- [x] Implement file plan generator (Store Spec â†’ Hydrogen file tree with intents)
- [x] Create file generation event handler (spec â†’ actual Hydrogen code files)
- [x] Build file explorer component showing generated file tree
- [x] Add code preview panel with syntax highlighting (TypeScript/JSX/CSS)
- [x] Create HITL review interface with deployment summary
- [x] Add deployment status tracking and file count display
- [x] Implement progress tracking through complete workflow (25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%)
- [x] Test complete workflow: Spec â†’ File Plan â†’ Generated Files â†’ Review
- [x] Fix crash after generation by removing automatic file generation trigger
- [x] Fix markdown code fence stripping for clean code display

**Implementation Notes:**
- File explorer uses flat list approach (no recursion) for stability
- Split-view layout: file list (320px) + code preview (flex-1)
- Selected file highlighting with click-to-view functionality
- Review page shows file summary and deployment readiness
- All async operations have proper loading states and error handling

## Phase 4: Multi-Provider AI System Fixed âœ…

### Provider System Overhaul
- [x] Fix provider selection to use environment variables (os.getenv) instead of state properties
- [x] Remove broken OpenRouter and Mistral code paths
- [x] Implement working OpenAI primary provider
- [x] Implement working Anthropic fallback provider
- [x] Fix return value handling (client, model tuple)
- [x] Update all generation methods to handle both OpenAI and Anthropic responses
- [x] Remove model validation code that caused 404 errors
- [x] Test complete provider system end-to-end

**Working Provider Priority:**
1. **OpenAI** (Primary)
   - All tasks: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Uses: `AsyncOpenAI` client
   - Response: `response.choices[0].message.content`
   
2. **Anthropic** (Fallback)
   - All tasks: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
   - Uses: `AsyncAnthropic` client
   - Response: `response.content[0].text`

### Hydrogen-Specific Code Generation
- [x] Enhanced prompts with Hydrogen API patterns
- [x] Added Remix/React Router conventions (loader, meta exports)
- [x] Required @shopify/hydrogen-react component usage
- [x] Added Storefront API client patterns (context.storefront.query)
- [x] Included GraphQL query examples
- [x] Added TailwindCSS styling requirements

**Hydrogen Code Requirements:**
- âœ… Routes export: `loader`, `meta`, default component
- âœ… Uses `@shopify/hydrogen-react` components (Money, Image, CartForm)
- âœ… Storefront API client via `context.storefront.query()`
- âœ… Follows Remix conventions (React Router v6+)
- âœ… TypeScript + TailwindCSS for styling
- âœ… SEO and a11y patterns included

**Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Primary provider (âœ“ Available)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Fallback provider (âœ“ Available)

## Phase 5: Critical File Generation Fixes âœ…

### All Critical Issues FIXED
- [x] **Empty file content on first navigation** - Files now generate immediately when "Generate File Plan" button is clicked on /specs page
- [x] **Markdown code fence stripping** - Enhanced `_strip_markdown_code` to properly handle ```tsx, ```typescript, ```jsx, ```javascript, ```ts, ```js, ``` formats
- [x] **Wrong directory structure** - Files now generate in `hydrogen_output/` directory with proper Hydrogen project structure
- [x] **Review & Deploy split** - Successfully separated into distinct /review and /deploy pages with appropriate functionality
- [x] **Updated navigation flow** - Brief â†’ Spec â†’ Files (auto-generates) â†’ Review â†’ Deploy
- [x] **Download functionality** - Review page includes download project as zip capability
- [x] **GitHub integration prep** - Deploy page ready for GitHub push using GITHUB_TOKEN env var
- [x] **Progress tracking** - Updated percentages: 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 90% â†’ 95% â†’ 100%

### Proper Hydrogen File Structure
```
hydrogen_output/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _index.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ collections.$handle.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products.$handle.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProductCard.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shopify.client.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ queries/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tokens.css.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.template
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Fixed Workflow
1. **Brief Input** (/) â†’ User enters project details
2. **Generate Spec** (/specs) â†’ AI creates Store Spec JSON (50%)
3. **Generate File Plan** (/specs button) â†’ Automatically triggers file generation (75-90%)
4. **View Files** (/files) â†’ Browse generated Hydrogen project files with content already loaded (90%)
5. **Review** (/review) â†’ Preview project summary, download zip (95%)
6. **Deploy** (/deploy) â†’ Push to GitHub, deploy to Oxygen (100%)

### Markdown Stripping Enhancement
The `_strip_markdown_code` method now properly:
- Detects code fences: ``` at start and end of content
- Finds first newline after opening fence (removes language identifier line)
- Finds last occurrence of \n``` (the closing fence)
- Extracts clean code between these boundaries
- Returns unchanged content if no fences detected

**Verified Working:**
- âœ… Strips ```tsx...``` correctly
- âœ… Strips ```typescript...``` correctly  
- âœ… Strips ```jsx...``` correctly
- âœ… Strips ```javascript...``` correctly
- âœ… Strips ``` (plain)...``` correctly
- âœ… Leaves non-fenced code unchanged
